# 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Fix for Parineetha Institute

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Image Loading Problem**
- **Problem**: Next.js Image optimization doesn't work with static export
- **Solution**: Added `unoptimized: true` to next.config.ts
- **Result**: Images will now load properly on Hostinger

### 2. **Static Export Configuration**
- **Problem**: Static hosting requires specific configurations
- **Solution**: Added `trailingSlash: true` for better compatibility
- **Result**: Better URL handling on static hosting

### 3. **Metadata Base URL**
- **Problem**: Open Graph images not resolving correctly
- **Solution**: Added `metadataBase: new URL('https://parineetha.in')`
- **Result**: Proper social media sharing images

## 📁 Files to Upload to Hostinger:

After running `npm run build`, upload the entire **`out`** folder contents to your Hostinger public_html directory:

```
public_html/
├── _next/
├── about/
├── contact/
├── courses/
├── Parineetha-removebg-preview.png
├── icon.png
├── index.html
├── sitemap.xml
├── robots.txt
└── 404.html
```

## 🔧 Re-deployment Steps:

1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload the `out` folder contents:**
   - Go to your Hostinger File Manager
   - Delete all files in public_html
   - Upload all files from the `out` folder to public_html

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Check https://parineetha.in
   - All images should now load properly
   - Logo should appear in navbar and footer

## ✅ What's Fixed:

- ✅ **Logo images** will load correctly
- ✅ **Company logos carousel** will display properly  
- ✅ **Success story images** will show up
- ✅ **All static assets** will work on Hostinger
- ✅ **SEO optimization** with proper metadata
- ✅ **404 page** will work correctly

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. Run `npm run build` in your project
2. Upload the new build to Hostinger
3. Your website should work perfectly with all images loading!

The main issue was that Next.js Image component requires server-side optimization, but static hosting doesn't support this. By adding `unoptimized: true`, we've disabled the optimization and made it compatible with static hosting like Hostinger.
